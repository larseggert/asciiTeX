DESCRIPTION
asciiTeX is an ASCII equation renderer released under the terms of the GNU
General Public License. The program can generate ASCII-art representations of 
mathematical equations. You can use asciiTeX to quickly insert equations in 
e.g. e-mails or comments in your source-code. The syntax is similar to LaTex. 
The asciiTeX project is a fork of eqascii, providing new features and many 
bug fixes to the original program. The latest addition to the program is a
graphical user interface written in GTK

INSTALLING FROM SOURCES
unpack the source and do the usual
./configure
make
make install
[make install-man]

This will provide two programs to your system, asciiTeX, the command line 
utility, and asciiTeX_gui, the graphical application. To disable compilation 
of the graphical application you can specify --diable-gtk to the configure 
script. The last optional make install-man installs the manual pages for both
programs


INSTALLING THE WINDOWS BINARY
Download and execute the installer script.
