18 Jan 2010 asciiTeX v 0.21
	Added a help button to the GTK interface. The help button displays some syntax help and exaples
	you can copy directly from the output to the input window.
15 Jan 2010 asciiTeX v 0.2
	Created a new GTK user-interface. I switched to the GNU build utillities (autoconf, automake, 
	etc.) Updated documentation.
03 Jan 2010 asciiTeX v 0.1
	I failed to contact the original author. Thus I decided to change the name and call it a fork.
	Minor bugfix in findClosingLRBrace.
	The first version of asciiTeX is set back to version 0.1
	
21 Dec 2009 eqascii v0.5.3
	Bugfix in super and subscript. 
	
17 Dec 2009 eqascii v0.5.2
	Added alignment options in array. The syntax is now the same as in LaTeX
	\begin{array}[pos]{columnalignments} ... \end{array}
	pos indicates the alignment of the array and can be t(op), c(enter) or b(ottom). If omitted 
	the alignment is center. The columnalignment is one character per column, l(eft), c(enter), 
	or r(ight).
	
15 Dec 2009 eqascii v0.5.1
	Minor bugs. Restored the library part. The interface now only exports one function EqASCII
	which returns an array of characters containing the equation in pretty print.
	
13 Dec 2009 eqascii v0.5.0
	Added \\ for breaking a line. It basically creates an array with one column. Per default 
	eqascii now tries to fit the equations on a line of 80 characters wide. The line length 
	can be set using the -ll option. If you give a line length of 0 eqascii will not insert line 
	breaks. Eqascii breaks lines after =,+,-,*,/,~ in the main expression (i.e., these characters
	are ignored if they occur within an array environment or in expressions like \sqrt, \frac,
	etc). I further added the possibility to read the equation from a file (with the -f option).
	The line breaking option bumps the version to 0.5.x
	  
03 Dec 2009 eqascii v0.4.3
	I still found there were issues after the initial memory debuging round. I did some 
	additional memory debugging with electricfence and valgrind. 
	
	More debugging of the array routines. Now removed all the custom initializations being done 
	there. All initializations of Tgraphs now go via the NewChild routine.
	
02 Dec 2009 eqascii v0.4.2
	Time to work on memory management. The code was full of memory leaks (not really an issue
	for the current form of the program, it only exits without properly cleaning up, if you
	want to use the code in a library it may be called many times during program execution.
	In tests for such cases I experienced segfaults). 
	
	Many small fixes. The array routines were a mayor source of memory leaks. Modiefied the
	Tgraph struct to include some pointers used for arrays. This used to be done by 
	typecasting a Tarray struct to a Tgraph struct. Needlesly confusing during deallocation.
	Now a Tgraph is a Tgraph and not sometimes secretly a Tarray.
	
24 Jul 2009 eqascii v0.4.1
	- Reduced the number of files, e.g. grouping all symbols.
	- I tried to structure the parsing routines. The parsing pprocedure is still a bit messy 
	  but I added a keyword tale and lookup functions. Further improvements could easily be 
	  made but would require a more extesive rewrite.
	- Added several new mathematical elements \overline{}, \underline{}, \limit{} and \to
	- The code did very little sanity checks which could lead to pretty hard crashes on
	  ill formatted equations. I added some sanity checks, fixing sevral cases of uncomplete
	  function definitions or overcomplete function definitions(with spurious characters).
	  Equations like 'a^', and '\sqrt' would result in segfaults.
	  Equations like '\sqrtdjashfjksh{5}' would give a square root without any notification.
	  The code will now give hopefully helpfull errors and warnings.
		
	
23 Jul 2009 eqascii v0.4.0
	I (Bart Pieters) downloaded the original program by Przemek Borys and took it upon me to
	make eqascii more feature complete and less buggy.
	- I removed the library stuff to avoid confusion. I first want to make the code more 
	feature complete, then we'll see further.
	
	I revamped the look of the equations. Mostly things that are a matter of taste but
	I 've got that :)	 
	- Changed the integral sign from this   _  to   _
	                                       |       /

	                                      _|      _/
	- I changed the look of sqrt:

	The implementation of braces was primitive. 
	- The size of braces should adapt to what is inbetween the braces but it adapts to the 
	  size of the parent (i.e. it adapts to the maximal vertical size of the parent and the 
	  child where it should always adapt the vertical size of the child). To clarify:
	  	"\left(x+1\right)\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)"
	  gives:
		(     )(1)    
		(x + 1)(-)    
		(     )(x)    
	  the vertical size braces around the term x+1 should be 1, not 3
	- The braces consisted of one character printed vertically over the height of the parent, 
	  which is not particularly pretty. 
	- You could close one type of braces with an arbitrary different type. I implemented 
	  error messages.
	- The implementation used a little dirty hack to make sure that the drawing routine knows 
	  which brace to draw. I implemented an options string in the graph struct to pass options
	  to the drawing routines. This may not only be used for which brace to use but also for
	  other options, such as "\sqrt[n]{x}" (the option [n] used to be ignored, but now also 
	  implemented), and alignment options for arrays (not implemented yet). 
13 Apr 2001 eqascii v0.3.1
	Ported the code to a library
	Added a tree deallocation procedure
1  Apr 2001 eqascii v0.3.0
	I have added array support. Now this program can be used to
	render most of common equation types (probably)
25 Mar 2001 eqascii v0.2.0, v0.2.1
	I have rewritten the code to gain modularity. Implemented
	devices are \frac, \sqrt, \sum, \int, and sub/superscript.
24 Mar 2001 eqascii v0.1.0
	I have visualised my conception about this renderer. I have
        imagined and designed all the data structures and their
        relationships.
