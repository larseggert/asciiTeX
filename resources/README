This directory contains several files useful when you want
to develop the gui further.

gui.glade is the glade description of the user interface. The
gui-description is included in the source-tree through the 
gui.h header file. To create this heaser file use:

gtk-builder-convert gui.glade gui.xml
XML_to_header.sh >gui.h

Note that the XML_to_header script assumes the xml file is 
called gui.xml.

The asciiTeX logo, used to decorate the window, is also 
included in the source-tree with the header file gui_ico.h.
The image is available in svg format and png format. I 
used the 64x64 pixels png image to generate the header file
by running:
dk-pixbuf-csource --name icon --struct logo.png > gui_ico.h
