# asciiTeX

asciiTeX is an ASCII equation renderer released under the terms of the GNU
General Public License. The program can generate ASCII art representations of
mathematical equations. You can use asciiTeX to quickly insert equations in,
e.g., emails or comments in your source code. The syntax is similar to LaTex.
The asciiTeX project is a fork of eqascii, providing new features and many bug
fixes to the original program.
